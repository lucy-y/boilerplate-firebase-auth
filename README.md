## 디렉토리
```
src/components: 컴포넌트들이 위치하는 디렉토리입니다.
src/pages: 각 라우트들이 위치하는 디렉토리 입니다.
src/client: 브라우저 측에서 사용할 최상위 컴포넌트 입니다. 우리가 추후 서버사이드 렌더링을 구현 할 것이기 때문에 디렉토리를 따로 구분하였습니다. (서버사이드 렌더링을 할 때에는 서버 전용 라우터를 써야합니다.) 여기서 라우터를 설정합니다.
src/server: 서버측에서 사용 할 리액트 관련 코드를 여기에 넣습니다.
src/shared: 서버와 클라이언트에서 공용으로 사용되는 컴포넌트 App.js 가 여기에 위치합니다.
src/lib: 나중에 웹 연동을 구현 할 때 사용 할 API와 코드스플리팅 할 때 필요한 코드가 여기에 위치합니다.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
